Our Lab was founded in September 2024 by Prof. Jia-qi Zheng. It is affiliated with the Guangdong Institute of Smart Education at Jinan University (JNU). We specialize in international large-scale educational assessment studies, such as PISA, TIMSS, and PIRLS. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies, including deep learning, machine learning, and explainable artificial intelligence. We aim to investigate key factors influencing students' cognitive and non-cognitive competencies, behavioral patterns, as well as crucial topics regarding affective computing, which covers emotion recognition, reasoning, and generation.

Our lab is a multidisciplinary team composed of researchers from educational technology, computer science, and sociology. Currently, our work focuses on topics including students’ academic resilience, self-efficacy, well-being, subject-specific competencies, and emotion-related processes in learning contexts.

We warmly welcome interdisciplinary collaboration. For further information or to discuss potential collaborations, please feel free to contact Prof. Jia-qi Zheng at **jqzheng@jnu.edu.cn**.
